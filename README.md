# RISC-V CPU Simulator (C, Computer Architecture)

A single-cycle RISC-V CPU simulator implemented in C for a Computer Architecture course.  
This project models a full five-stage datapath (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback) and supports RV64I instructions, memory operations, and an interactive execution shell.

## üß† Features
- Implements **RV64I instruction set**, register file, and memory operations
- Supports stepping through execution with an interactive shell
- Optional **1 KiB direct-mapped data cache** for memory hierarchy simulation
- Demonstrates key concepts in computer architecture: pipelining, instruction decoding, memory access, and writeback

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview
- **Language:** C  
- **Concepts Used:** Pipelined Datapath, Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Cache Simulation, Memory Hierarchy, Interactive Shell
- **Topics:** Computer Architecture, CPU Design, Cache Performance Analysis

## üîí Repository Access
This project was originally developed on a private course GitHub account.  
This repository documents the project structure, features, and technical implementation details for portfolio purposes.
